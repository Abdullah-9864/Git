Bytecode Generation Process:

When you execute a Python file (e.g., chai.py), the Python interpreter first compiles the source code into bytecode.
This bytecode is a low-level code that is platform-independent. This means the generated bytecode can run on any system with a Python Virtual Machine, regardless of the operating system.
The bytecode is typically stored in .pyc files within a __pycache__ folder. This folder is often hidden, especially for main execution files.
Bytecode generation is considered an intermediate step in Python's execution process. It's sometimes loosely referred to as "compiling," but Python is generally interpreted.
This process is particularly relevant when importing files, as it helps with optimization.
Python Virtual Machine (PVM):

After bytecode is generated, the Python Virtual Machine (PVM) fetches and executes it.
The PVM is a small software that continuously runs a loop. When it receives a file, it executes the code within it.
The PVM executes the code line by line, which is why Python is considered an interpreted language.
The PVM can also directly execute Python source code (.py files) without explicitly generating bytecode.
The PVM is also known as a runtime engine, which is essential for code execution in any programming language.
Bytecode is not machine code. It's a Python-specific interpretation that is then translated by the PVM into machine-executable instructions.

### 💡 How to Use This List
Think of this as your personalized curriculum. You don't have to do everything at once.
- **Start with Phase 1** resources to build your confidence.
- When you hit a topic in the roadmap (like "working with `datetime`"), jump to a **Phase 2** resource for a deep dive.
- Use the **Phase 4** guides as soon as you start a project that requires an external library (like `requests` for web scraping).
